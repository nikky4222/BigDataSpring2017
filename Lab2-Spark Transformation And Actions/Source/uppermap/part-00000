HOW
DO
I
LOVE
THEE?
LET
ME
COUNT
THE
WAYS.
I
LOVE
THEE
TO
THE
DEPTH
AND
BREADTH
AND
HEIGHT
MY
SOUL
CAN
REACH,
WHEN
FEELING
OUT
OF
SIGHT
FOR
THE
ENDS
OF
BEING
AND
IDEAL
GRACE
I
LOVE
THEE
TO
THE
LEVEL
OF
EVERYDAY'S
MOST
QUIET
NEED,
BY
SUN
AND
CANDLE-LIGHT.
I
LOVE
THEE
FREELY,
AS
MEN
STRIVE
FOR
RIGHT;
I
LOVE
THEE
PURELY,
AS
THEY
TURN
FROM
PRAISE.
I
LOVE
THEE
WITH
THE
PASSION
PUT
TO
USE
IN
MY
OLD
GRIEFS,
AND
WITH
MY
CHILDHOOD'S
FAITH
I
LOVE
THEE
WITH
A
LOVE
I
SEEM
TO
LOVE
WITH
MY
LOST
SAINTS,
-
I
LOVE
THEE
WITH
THE
BREATH,
SMILES,
TEARS,
OF
ALL
MY
LIFE!
-
AND,
IF
GOD
CHOOSE,
I
SHALL
BUT
LOVE
THEE
BETTER
AFTER
DEATH.
